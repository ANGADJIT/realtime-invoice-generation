# Realtime Invoice Generator

![Workflow](https://github.com/ANGADJIT/realtime-invoice-generation/assets/67195682/91df2362-c83f-4558-8f5d-1ea436f602b3)
## Workflow Explanation

We have a super heating real-time invoice generator app that follows the following workflow:

1. A Kinesis stream is continuously running on AWS.
2. An API written in FAST API is continuously running and integrated with the app.
3. When a successful Google Pay transaction occurs on the app, an event containing the transaction details is sent to a WebSocket named "invoice/generate."
4. The adjacent app receives the event and triggers a Lambda job running on a WebSocket.
5. The Lambda job processes the transaction data received through the Kinesis event.
6. After processing the data, the Lambda job renders it into an HTML template and converts it into a PDF.
7. The resulting PDF is stored in an S3 bucket with the name "Transaction ID.pdf."
8. Once the Lambda job completes, the FAST API checks for the file written by the Lambda job in the S3 bucket.
9. The FAST API retrieves the file and returns it to the app.
10. On the app side, the file is stored in the internal storage.
11. An intent is opened by Android, allowing the user to choose a PDF app to view the invoice.

## Tech Stack Used

For local testing outside the cloud environment, the following tech stack was used:

- LocalStack with Docker container to simulate AWS services.
- FAST API for writing APIs using Python.
- Flutter for the frontend.

The following cloud services were used within the LocalStack:

- Kinesis for capturing real-time payment events.
- Lambda job for generating invoices.
- Simple Storage Service (S3) for storing the invoices generated by the Lambda job.
